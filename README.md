# spack32

A SpaceAPI checker for an ESP32.

This tool turns the blue LED of an ESP32 on, if a certain space is open
or turns it off, if it is closed.
It checks the status of a space in a fixed interval.

Currently, this tool is configured to check the status of the Entropia
hackspace, but it can be easily adapted to your needs as well.
After all, it is just a 50 LOC thing.
